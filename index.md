A focus on making life easier and more enjoyable for the homeowner has given rise to _BeoLiving Intelligence_, the first Plug & Play smart home 
controller for _Bang & Olufsen_ products. _BeoLiving Intelligence_, [successor of _BeoLink Gateway_](bli-guides/bli-whats-new.md), is the new 
creation resulting from the _Bang & Olufsen_ and _Khimo_ partnership which dates back to 2006. _BeoLiving Intelligence_ expands the way _Bang & 
Olufsen_ products can work together, as well as allowing them to interact with many other brands of consumer electronic devices.

Together with the beautifully sculpted, simple and intuitive, companion _BeoLiving App_, all the magic that _BeoLiving Intelligence_ allows is 
directly accessible and configurable at the palm of your hand. Use the _BeoLiving App_ in your phone to easily control your _Bang & Olufsen_ 
products alongside the most popular Home Automation brands.

The main features of the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ controller are:

+ Control _Bang & Olufsen_ (NetworkLink type) products through your smart device.
+ Remote access of your installation.
+ Voice control of your installation through Alexa.
+ Support with IFTTT.
+ Creation of routines that automates the control of several products.

The _BeoLiving Intelligence_ controller is upgradable to a full professional smart home solution through a one-time paid license (_BeoLiving 
Intelligence PRO_). With this optional upgrade license, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ transforms into a controller for all world market brands of 
dedicated home automation systems. Even if you donâ€™t own any _Bang & Olufsen_ products, your unique home automation and audio/video ecosystem 
will be accessible as one entity through the expertly crafted _BeoLiving App_.

The main additions of the _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ upgrade are:

+ Integration with most popular Home Automation brands.
+ Web interface advanced configuration, with more customization such as area/zone creations, scenes and more.
+ Control your products through its web interface.
+ Control your products through _Bang & Olufsen_ TVs.
+ Customization of the _BeoLiving App_.
